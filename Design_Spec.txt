1. Function - What should the controller be able to do?
	i. One analog stick - (Insert digikey link)
	ii. Small screen to be connected via I2C
	iii. Two buttons A & B
	iv. Two LEDs (one to show power on, the other to show there is rf connection)
	v. Communication via radio frequency
	vi. Two extra buttons (purpose not defined yet) like Select Start on NES controller
	vii. battery (power bank, preferably small) connected to the USB-C port
	viii. USB port on the board to provide the power
	ix. Test points for STLink (SWD)
	x. power on/off switch

2. Performance - What will the product have to be?
	Inputs are succesfully sent to reciever and are displayed accurately
	Input delay is close to 8 ms (industry average)



3. Aesthetics - What should the controller look like?
	Generic Xinput controller style, 3D print a model that has two handles for a comfortable hand position, for prototyping using the PCB itself as a controller would be fine.

4. Technical Specifications - What mcu and sensors will the controller use?
	STM32-L432KB
	Accelerometer - potentially
	NRF24L01
	I2C screen
	Analog joystick - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032

Running notes:

	Need to figure out how STM32 sends packets of data to Raspberry Pi (the size, the frequency...) - make simple demo with only STM32, Pi, and two atenas (focus is on firmware)
